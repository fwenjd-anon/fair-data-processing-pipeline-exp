# Experiments&Analysis: Multi-step pipelines for fair classifications

This repository contains the codes needed to reproduce the experiments of our submitted SIGMOD 2024 paper

## General Information

- As this serves as an experimental & analysis paper, we evaluate different algorithms and thus reuse work from other GitHubs.<br />
- For an easier reproducibility we put them in our repository under the algorithms subfolders.<br />
- For some approaches, some slight adaptations had to be made to integrate them in our framework, but the general approach was not altered.<br />
- The experiments were run under Windows 10, Python Version 3.8.8.

## HOWTO RUN

- You need to run `run_experiments.py`. The parameters to set for the experiments (like turning components on/off) are descriped in that file.<br />
- An exception is for the combination of multiple algorithms. For this, you need to run `run_cross_stage_experiments.py` instead.<br />
- An evaluation file is automatically generated for an experiment, which shows the error rate and group fairness or individual fairness metrics.<br />
- In `Summary` multiple summaries of various experiments are provided. These are not automatically generated by the code.
